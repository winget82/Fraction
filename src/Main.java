        //If there is no "/" character, then every character in the string must be a number (if you removed the "-" sign).
        //If there is a "/" character, then it may be helpful to create substrings for the numerator and denominator.
        //Both substrings must be non-empty.
        //Both must be entirely made of numbers.
        //The denominator cannot be "0".
        //Hint 1: It may be useful to create a helper method isNumber() that takes a String as input and returns true

        //number 0-9 and false otherwise. This method can also check for

//Putting it all together:
//1. Write a short introduction method that describes the calculator program and welcomes your user
//2. Ask the user to enter in an operation
//3. As long as the user enters something thatâ€™s not "q" or "Q" when asked for an operation you should run the calculator
//4. Get two fractions from the user and then perform whichever operation they ask for
//5. Print the result of the operation
