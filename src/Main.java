        //If there is no "/" character, then every character in the string must be a number (if you removed the "-" sign). COULD USE A FOR LOOP ITERATING OVER EACH CHARACTER TO HANDLE THIS

        //If there is a "/" character, then it may be helpful to create substrings for the numerator and denominator.

        //Both substrings must be non-empty.
        //Both must be entirely made of numbers.
        //The denominator cannot be "0".

        //if every character in the String is a
        //number 0-9 and false otherwise. This method can also check forempty strings. Hint 2: Once you determine whether or not the Strings are
